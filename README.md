# ⚡ FPGA-based HVAC Control System

> By Rawsab Said and Muneeb Farrukh

## About the project:
* Behavioral VHDL was utilized to develop an interactive HVAC system simulation on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) board. Custom-designed components, such as binary counters, bidirectional shift registers, multiplexers, and comparators were used and implemented in this project.
* Moreover, the FPGA-based HVAC system was integrated with existing hardware, allowing for user control through switches and push buttons and also allowing for visual feedback through light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a seven-segment display.


**To interact with the simulation, upload the file ```fpga-hvac-control-system/output_files/LogicalStep_Lab3_top.sof``` to an appropriate FPGA device/Logical STEP board.**
