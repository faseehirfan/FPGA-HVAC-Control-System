# FPGA-based HVAC Control System

> By Faseeh Irfan

## About the project:
* Behavioral VHDL was used to develop an interactive HVAC system simulation on an FPGA board. Custom-designed components, such as binary counters, bidirectional shift registers, multiplexers, and comparators were used and implemented in this project.
* The HVAC system was integrated with existing hardware. User input was taken through switches and push buttons. Visual feedback was also implemented through LEDs and a Seven-Segment Display.


**To interact with the simulation, upload the file ```output_files/LogicalStep_Lab3_top.sof``` to an appropriate FPGA device/Logical STEP board.**
